# Workshop-Dingo-Godot-2025
Repository for the Godot workshop held on January 16th 2025

The main branch of this repository contains the barebones assets that we will be using to create a top-down shooter 2D game.

For students who are attending the workshop, please download the project from the "main" branch rather than the dev branch
